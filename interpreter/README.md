You can find the interpereter and its files in the "/interpreter" directory.

You can run is by executing the "main.py" <INPUT_FILE>
f.e. [ python3 main.py test_func00.txt ]

the "INPUT_FILE" is essentially a file where an example of my custom language is written.

for the exercise, I had to use the next features and higher orde functions in my code.

Classes with inheritance        -> yes (tokens.py, parser.py)
Object-printing for every class -> yes
Type-annotation                 -> yes

3 Higher orde Functions:
Map    -> main.py      ; line 3   and ProgState.py ; line 103 
Filter -> ProgState.py ; line 103
Reduce -> main.py      ; line 13

P.S. the lines ending on '3' is just a coincedence lmao
